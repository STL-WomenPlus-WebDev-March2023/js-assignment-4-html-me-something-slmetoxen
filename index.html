               <h2># 1 "How to help the world."</h2>
               <p>This sounded so cute. Of course I would want to build a webpage that would help the world. "What are some ideas that could help the world?" I asked.</p>
              <ul>
               <li>"A house that you never have to leave so your kids don't cry when they have to go to the store or other places you don't want to go."</li>
               <li>"Teleporter, so you don't have to wait so long for vacation if you missed your plane."</li>
               <li>"The ability to never have to die again."</li>
               <li>"Toys that could do whatever you want so that parents wouldn't have to hear other people's kids scream."</li>
               </ul>
               <p>...so maybe that's a little more than I'm ready to tackle at this point. Let's keep moving.</p>

              <h2>#2 "A blanket that you don't have to struggle to get on a tall chair with."</h2>
              <p>I had to restate the answer on this one and get creative. I searched a few images for 'wearable blankets for kids' and fell into the never-ending world of options. About 22,500,000 results appeared beneath my search bar. I'm done. I have little to no interest in this idea. Let's move on to the next idea. </p>

              <h2>#3 "A website that tells you how Rescue Bots move their joints and transform so fast."</h2>
              <p>Now there's a thought. How do they move their joints so fast? Off I went to find some kind of wonderful explanation to help educate a curious child. (Supermom!)</p>
              <p>Well, it's the thought that counts right? That led to yet another episode of information overload. Today is not the day to deep dive into the world of robotics but, for those of you who care to learn more about Robotics head over to the last place I stopped and see if this satisfies your own transformer questions. If anything, it's worth a peek. &#8680<a href='https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/mobile-robot-2-concept-urdf/' target='_blank'>  Articulated Robotics</a> </p>

               <h2>#4 "A learning app so kids can still be on screens while it's screen break."</h2>
               <p>This thought came much later and needless to say it was during a 'screen break'.</p>
               <p>Alright, I think we have a winner! Too bad I have to go help a 5-Year-Old find something to do. Oh well, until next time...</p>
